# Ads_sentiment_predictor
This project aims to predict the sentiments of advertising videos by utilizing deep learning techniques. It is considered to be a very challenging task due to the complexity of the visual world. For example, oftentimes a website might ask a user to verify one is human by selecting the correct visual prompt from a CAPTCHA; these quick checks give high confidence that a real human and not a bot is accessing the website, because it is difficult for computers to accurately interpret the patterns of image or videos. To enable this research, the study uses a dataset of 1,992 advertising videos downloaded from YouTube and rich annotation of sentiments, funny and exciting scores. The project extracted video features using a pre-trained model-ResNet101, and modeled videos with a gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. This study was able to achieve a 36.8% accuracy rate with GRU and 38.5% with LSTM on predicting sentiments, 81.05% accuracy on predicting funny or not, and 76.72% on classifying exciting or not exciting.
